# Helium-Hotspot-Holster-and-Antenna-Mount
This is a vertical hang "holster" for a [Helium Hotpot](https://helium.com) with a beam to allow "through the window" antenna mount. It also dramatically dims the LED on the front of the hotspot by putting it behind part of the mount. ;)

## Disclaimer 

1. **It's always recommended to ground outside antennas.**  You REALLY need to check with your local electrical / building codes to see if there is a need to ground your antenna.  
1. This is not a recomendation for any of these parts!
